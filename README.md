OpenSpending is a project to make government finances easier to explore and understand. It started out as "Where does my money go", a platform to visualize the United Kingdom's state finance, but has been renamed and restructured to allow arbitrary financial data to be loaded and displayed. 

The main use for the software is the site [http://openspending.org](openspending.org) which aims to track government finance around the world.

OpenSpending's code is licensed under the GNU Affero Licence except where otherwise indicated. A copy of this licence is available in the file [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).

**You can find the old OpenSpending v2, and the complete history for the codebase to that point, in the [`openspending-monolith` branch](https://github.com/openspending/openspending/tree/openspending-monolith).**

## Quick start
