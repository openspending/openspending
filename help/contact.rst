Who we are
''''''''''

OpenSpending is a project operated by the `Open Knowledge Foundation
<http://okfn.org>`_, UK-based non-profit organization. The OKF is a 
community-driven organization that aims to promote open knowledge
and data. We build tools and communities that enable the collaborative
use and production of digital information.

Our funders

OpenSpending is a community-driven project, but we would not be able
