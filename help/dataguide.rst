Guide for data wranglers
========================

Data wranglers are community members who help to map the money by 
finding, cleaning and loading datasets from various sources. If you 
are interested in doing this, check out the following resources:

 * What should my data contain?
 * How do I clean my data?

Once the data is loaded, OpenSpending will offer you a set of APIs
and interfaces to work with the information - read the 
developer and designer guide to learn more.
