Guide for developers and designers
==================================

OpenSpending aims to be a simple-to-use platform for developers. The 
site offers a variety of APIs that can be used to create new 
visualizations, reports and other applications:

* Background: How does OpenSpending store data?
* Which APIs are available? 
* Aggregation API
* Which REST resources are exposed?
* Full-text search API
* Loading via remote calls

Of course, OpenSpending is an open source project and we aim to include contributions
into production as quickly as possible. So if you feel like hacking core, check out the 
GitHub issues and join us on IRC (#openspending on FreeNode).
