Translation workflow:

Update .pot file from source:

$ python setup.py extract_messages

Examine the .pot (or at least its diff) for bogus messages, and fix up
any errors in the source. Pay particular attention to genshi
templates. Documentation for the uninitiated:

http://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/i18n.html

Commit the updated .pot

Update .po files from .pot:

$ python setup.py update_catalog

Ship .po files off for translation


To update the translations used in the website, or add new languages,
edit openspending/ui/i18n/supported_langs.txt ; there is a template
for this file in openspending/ui/i18n/supported_langs.txt_tmpl ; you must
list each language code on a separate line.

Once you have configured the supported languages, run

bin/update_translations
