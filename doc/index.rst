Welcome to OpenSpending's documentation!
========================================

OpenSpending is a project to make government finances easier to explore
and understand. It started out as "Where does my money go", a platform 
to visualize the United Kingdom's state finance, but has been renamed 
and restructured to allow arbitrary financial data to be loaded and 
displayed. The key use case for the software is the site openspending.org
which aims to tracker government finance around the world.
